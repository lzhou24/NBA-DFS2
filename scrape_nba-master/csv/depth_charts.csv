12,Atlanta Hawks,C,12,Tiago Splitter,"Tiago Splitter (hip) has begun riding an exercise bike, and he's now walking with just one crutch.","Splitter underwent season-ending hip surgery on February 26, so it's nice to see him already working on his conditioning less than a month removed from the surgery. He's going to miss the 2016 Olympic Games, and he might not be ready when the 2016-17 season begins."

15,Brooklyn Nets,PG,2,Jarrett Jack,Jarrett Jack (knee surgery) is expected to be cleared for basketball activities in about a month and a half.,"He was diagnosed with a torn right ACL and meniscus back in January, but initial reports indicated that he will be ready for the 2016-17 season. The Nets hold a team option on him worth $6.3 million, and he could be a starter again next season unless they bring in another point guard this summer. He averaged 12.8 points, 7.4 assists, 4.3 boards, 1.1 steals and 1.0 3-pointers in 32 games during the 2015-16 campaign."

22,Brooklyn Nets,PF,9,Thaddeus Young,"Thaddeus Young has been shut down for the remainder of the season, joining Brook Lopez.","The Nets don't have anything left to play for, but it should be noted that Young is still healthy. The Nets want to get an extended look at the rest of their roster, so Thomas Robinson and Chris McCullough should see a bump in minutes at the four moving forward. Robinson needs to be added everywhere for his excellent rebounding numbers."
23,Brooklyn Nets,PF,10,Thomas Robinson,Thomas Robinson (knee) has been ruled out for Wednesday's game against the Raptors.,"Henry Sims and Chris McCullough figure to make up the Nets starting frontcourt on Wednesday sans Robinson, while Bojan Bogdanovic will likely spend some time at the four-spot. It's not a great matchup for Sims or McCullough, so those guys will be slightly risky punts in DFS on a 14-game Wednesday night, despite the increased opportunity. Robinson was excellent as a starter this season, so he'll likely be opting out of his contract in order to hit the open market as an unrestricted free agent this offseason."
24,Brooklyn Nets,PF,11,Chris McCullough,,
25,Brooklyn Nets,PF,12,Willie Reed,Willie Reed (personal) will not play again for Brooklyn this season.,"Reed is stepping away from a ton of opportunity with Brook Lopez (rest) and Thaddeus Young (rest) done for the year, and it's currently unclear exactly what's going on with his personal life. We wish him the best, but with Reed unavailable, Thomas Robinson, Chris McCullough and Henry Sims figure to log heavy minutes for the Nets, with Robinson offering the most upside out of the group."
26,Brooklyn Nets,C,13,Brook Lopez,"Sean Marks has assured Brook Lopez that he will be a building block for the franchise, and not a trade chip.","""He has talked to me, and we both definitely want to be here and see things happen here and help the team grow going forward,"" said Lopez. While Lopez will sit out the Nets final six games of the season for rest purposes, the 2015-16 season will mark Lopez' second consecutive year of sustained health after a brutal injury plagued three-year stretch. He'll make for a fine early-round selection in next year's fantasy drafts."

28,Boston Celtics,PG,0,Isaiah Thomas,Isaiah Thomas vowed to be better next season.,"""I'm going to do whatever it takes to not have this feeling again because it really hurt me,"" Thomas said. ""I'm going to use that as motivation to continue to get better and work on my flaws and make those into my strengths. I promise you I'll be back better."" Thomas was a top-40 player in standard 9-cat leagues this season with averages of 22.2 points, 6.2 assists, 3.0 boards, 1.1 steals and 2.0 3-pointers, so he won't be cheap in fantasy drafts next season."
29,Boston Celtics,PG,1,Marcus Smart,,
30,Boston Celtics,PG,2,Terry Rozier,,
31,Boston Celtics,SG,3,Avery Bradley,Celtics GM Danny Ainge said that Avery Bradley (hamstring) likely wouldn't have returned in the postseason.,"""The hamstring injury Avery had, a Grade 1 strain, it’s risky,"" said Ainge. ""You want to be really careful with that because, if you get a second hamstring injury, then they sort of have a tendency to linger throughout your career. So we probably wouldn’t have let Avery go back out unless he was just 100 percent and felt absolutely nothing. But I think that was always a long shot."" Bradley will have plenty of time to recover this offseason and his stock should be pretty high in fantasy after averaging 15.2 points, 2.1 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.9 3-pointers this season."

58,Chicago Bulls,PG,0,Derrick Rose,Derrick Rose isn't thinking about his impending free agency after the 2016-17 season.,"While Rose has one season left on his contract with the Bulls, he said he isn't thinking ahead to his upcoming free agency. ""I'll think about that when that time comes,"" Rose said. ""As far as right now, the only thing I can think about is this offseason. I've had that mentality ever since my injuries. I learned to deal with reality and live in the moment."" While Rose isn't the player he once was, he improved his game after the All-Star Break and is still just 27 years old, so he's worth a late-round flier in 2016-17 fantasy drafts."

66,Chicago Bulls,PF,8,Taj Gibson,Taj Gibson (ribs) and E'Twaun Moore (left hamstring) are out for the remainder of the season.,"It's not a surprise for either player, and the Bulls are simply making it official rather than dragging it out over the final two games of the year. Gibson's absence will open up a real opportunity for Cristiano Felicio with Pau Gasol's (knee) campaign also over, while Moore's continued stint on the sidelines will provide a clear path to minutes for Aaron Brooks with Derrick Rose's (rest) year also over."

""For starters, nobody knows if Tim is retiring and he’s somebody whom I have maximum respect for. In closing, I have to admit the Spurs would be an interesting option for me."" The Bulls took a massive risk by not dealing Gasol at the trade deadline, and there's a good chance that he leaves Chicago this summer in the pursuit of another ring. To be clear, a move to San Antonio wouldn't be great for his fantasy value."
71,Chicago Bulls,C,13,Joakim Noah,The Timberwolves may try and go after Joakim Noah as an unrestricted free agent this offseason.,"Noah's agent Bill Duffy also represents Andrew Wiggins and Zach LaVine, and given the mutual respect between Noah and newly appointed head coach Tom Thibodeau, Minnesota could be on the radar for Noah. If Noah does wind up in Minnesota, that wouldn't be great news for Gorgui Dieng's fantasy outlook."

88,Dallas Mavericks,PG,0,Deron Williams,Deron Williams (hernia) intends to opt out of his contract with Dallas for the 2016-17 season.,"He will look for a multi-year contract in free agency, but there is said to be mutual interest between Williams and Dallas for a return. ""I would love to be back,"" Williams said during his exit interviews. ""This was a great year for me. My family is settled and happy here, so it'd definitely be great to be back."" Williams averaged 14.1 points and 5.8 assists this season and played well for the most part, but he struggled with injuries once again and a sports hernia ended his 2015-16 campaign. He will need surgery to correct the issue, but he's expected to be healthy by training camp."
89,Dallas Mavericks,PG,1,Jose Juan Barea,J.J. Barea is set to undergo arthroscopic surgery on his right knee later this week in order to clean up his meniscus.,"Arthroscopic surgery is usually only a 4-6 week recovery period, and Barea said he's still hopeful to play for Puerto Rico at the Olympics this summer. He has plenty of time to rest up for the 2016-17 season, but it's unlikely he plays enough at the start of the year to warrant a draft selection in standard formats."

93,Dallas Mavericks,SF,5,Chandler Parsons,Chandler Parsons is expected to opt out of his contract and become an unrestricted free agent.,"Parsons has a $16M option, but it looks like it's just a matter of time until he officially declines it. CP's tenure (to date) has not gone according to plan in Dallas, and it's nowhere near certain that he'll return to the Mavs. Despite knee issues hampering his two-year run with the Mavs, Parsons figures to be a desired commodity on the open market and could command more money than Mark Cuban's team feels comfortable paying. In what has become an annual tradition, Dallas could be looking at some serious roster shuffling around Dirk Nowitzki this summer. We think Dirk deserves better for everything he's done and every sacrifice he's made for this franchise, but that's another story entirely. For what it's worth, President of Basketball Operations Donnie Nelson has been non-committal about a potential Parsons return."
94,Dallas Mavericks,SF,6,Justin Anderson,,
95,Dallas Mavericks,SF,7,Jeremy Evans,Jeremy Evans (right shoulder surgery) will miss the rest of the season.,Evans underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a torn labrum on his right shoulder on Thursday and will miss the rest of the season.

100,Dallas Mavericks,C,12,David Lee,David Lee (foot) is in a walking boot and has been ruled out of the remainder of the first round.,"Dallas is down 3-1 vs. OKC, and there is no reason for Lee to continue to push through an obvious issue that is limiting his ability to contribute. Given Salah Mejri's (hip) status is up in the air, the options include giving Zaza Pachulia an extended role or going small with Dirk Nowitzki in the middle while deploying some unorthodox lineups. Expect Justin Anderson's role to increase for however long Dallas is able to stay alive."
101,Dallas Mavericks,C,13,Salah Mejri,Salah Mejri (hip) is listed as inactive for Monday.,"This is very odd with Mejri going through his pre-game warmups. Assuming the lineup sheet is accurate, we won't see Mejri out there. JaVale McGee will probably be in the rotation."

""I’m so proud of how he bounced back from a major injury. He’s fully back, back better than ever. You’d be hard-pressed to find 10 tougher offensive matchups in the NBA."" An unfortunate ankle injury cut his season short, but he looked great this year with averages of 19.5 points, 5.3 boards, 2.5 assists, 0.8 steals and 1.6 3-pointers on 41.0 percent shooting. He has some durability concerns, but he will be a nice mid-round pick next season."

""I think a lot of it is having this off-season to work on it."" Hammond added that MCW is a ""really good fit for this team"" on the defensive end, and the PG still believes that he will have a significant role next season even though Giannis Antetokounmpo will be running the offense. ""I think he is definitely going to control the ball a lot more, but he's not going to guard a point guard,"" MCW said. ""I'll be guarding the point guard."""

With both Michael Carter-Williams (hip) and Mayo set to spend the remainder of the year on the sidelines, Jerryd Bayless and Tyler Ennis will be soaking up all the point guard minutes in Milwaukee.

He's bound for free agency and it'll be interesting to see where he winds up, but as a backup point guard, he won't be worth drafting in most leagues."
267,New Orleans Pelicans,PG,1,Jrue Holiday,Pelicans head coach Alvin Gentry said Jrue Holiday is part of the Pelicans core.,"Gentry said Holiday and Anthony Davis are the core of the team moving forward and added that Holiday had a fantastic season once his minutes restriction was lifted. While Holiday didn't stay healthy this season, his injuries didn't involve his troublesome leg and his post-All Start Break averages of 21.2 points, 3.3 rebounds, 7.3 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.7 three-pointers per game point to a breakout 2016-17 season."

Gordon broke his finger for the second time this season which required surgery, but he should be ready to go for the start of the 2016-17 campaign. He finished with averages of 15.2 points, 2.7 assists, 2.2 boards, 1.0 steals and 2.5 3-pointers."
271,New Orleans Pelicans,SG,5,Bryce Dejean-Jones,Bryce Dejean-Jones had wrist surgery on Friday and will miss the rest of the season.,"It's a tough blow, but at least he was able to pick up a contract before the injury. Dejean-Jones will be ready to go for next season, but his role is unclear. The Pelicans luckily get Eric Gordon (finger) back tomorrow, so he'll be thrust into a nice role off the bat."
272,New Orleans Pelicans,SG,6,Tyreke Evans,Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said that Tyreke Evans (knee) struggled to learn the offense because he missed training camp.,"''We had a small sample size,'' Gentry said. ''He never had an opportunity to go through training camp. So we just rushed in, and said, 'Ok', now this is way we play. I think he had some great moments and I think he struggled some."" Evans played in just 25 games this season with averages of 15.2 points, 6.6 assists and 5.2 rebounds, but he's had three knee surgeries since May and has some serious durability concerns. He's going to be a risky pick in fantasy drafts next season."
273,New Orleans Pelicans,SF,7,Alonzo Gee,Alonzo Gee has been diagnosed with a complete tear of right proximal rectus femoris and will miss the remainder of the 2015-16 season.,"The injuries just keep piling up in New Orleans, and the Pelicans now have more injured players on the roster than healthy ones. With Gee done for the year, Dante Cunningham, Luke Babbitt and Jordan Hamilton will be logging major minutes for a Pelicans team that has been decimated by injuries, and Babbitt is worth a look in deep leagues for those seeking a 3-point specialist."

279,New Orleans Pelicans,PF,13,Anthony Davis,"Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said he will give Anthony Davis (knee) more opportunities to be the ""go-to guy"" next season.","""He’ll continue to grow as a player,"" Gentry said. ""He just celebrated his 23rd birthday. He wants to be great. I think you’ll see him get stronger and he’ll become a better post-up player. I think his mid-range shooting game has been great. He made 35 threes this year, after making [three] his whole career before that. I also think you’ll see him become more of a go-to guy. I think he wants to do that, and we’ll give him more opportunities for him to do that."" Davis is looking at a three-four month recovery from knee surgery and will be a risky pick in fantasy next season due to his durability concerns despite the obvious upside."
280,New Orleans Pelicans,PF,14,Ryan Anderson,Ryan Anderson (sports hernia) will miss the Pelicans' regular-season finale Wednesday vs. Minnesota.,"Injuries again have ended Anderson's season early, and he'll finish his 2015-16 campaign with averages of 17.0 points, 6.0 boards and 2.0 triples through 66 games. He's going to be an unrestricted free agent this offseason, and the prototypical stretch-four figures to earn a massive payday on the open market. He'll be worth a mid-round selection in next year's drafts, despite the injury risk."
281,New Orleans Pelicans,C,15,Omer Asik,,
282,New Orleans Pelicans,C,16,Alexis Ajinca,Alexis Ajinca (shoulder) will not play Wednesday vs. Minnesota.,"Ajinca will join 10 other Pelicans on the sidelines for Wednesday's regular-season finale, and his absence will translate to major minutes for Dante Cunningham and James Ennis. Omer Asik and Kendrick Perkins will be the only healthy centers on the roster for Wednesday's game, but even with just seven healthy players on the roster, Asik and Perkins are not great targets."

284,New York Knicks,PG,0,Jose Calderon,Jose Calderon (quad) will not play against the Pacers on Tuesday.,"The Knicks were hoping Calderon might play again this season, but he'll now miss the regular season finale on Tuesday.

That’s what I want to be. That’s my mindset from here on out."" The Knicks signed Wroten to get a good look at him during the summer league, and several reports have indicated that Phil Jackson is a fan. Wroten admitted that he wasn't 100 percent when he returned from his knee injury with Philly earlier in the season which would explain his poor play, so maybe he can redeem himself next season."

Thomas is set to get a significant pay raise this summer after averaging 8.2 points, 2.2 boards, 0.9 assists and 0.7 3-pointers on 44.2 percent shooting from the field and 40.4 percent from deep. The New York Post speculates that Thomas' salary could start at $4.5 million per year, but it would make a lot of sense for the Knicks to upgrade their backcourt before they do anything else."

Instead of playing in the Olympics, Porzingis will utilize the summer to make sure his shoulder is right and train with the team, which will include an effort to work on his post game.

435,Washington Wizards,PG,0,John Wall,John Wall's (knee surgeries) status for training camp is currently unknown.,"He obviously won't play for Team USA this summer, but he is expected to be ready for the start of the 2016-17 season. The surgery on Wall's right knee is reportedly pretty minor and routine, but the operation on his left knee in which he had calcium deposits removed would have sidelined him for months if he   underwent the procedure during the season. Fantasy owners would feel a lot more confident about drafting him if he's ready in time for camp, but we'll be tracking his progress closely."

438,Washington Wizards,SG,3,Bradley Beal,Bradley Beal is hoping to use the summer to get his troublesome right leg back to full strength.,"""I’m thinking of different methods, if I want to stick to the routine I’ve been on the  last couple years, if I want to start lifting more or lifting less, do more running. I definitely have to change my diet,"" Beal said. ""I’m very unique. Nobody else has this injury but me. It’s hard to reach out and research anybody else who has it and what they’ve done for it. It’s like I’m a guinea pig and just testing out things and see if they work or not. I trust the doctors."" Beal has developed a stress reaction in his lower right leg in four straight seasons, so he's going to be a risky pick in fantasy regardless of where he lands in restricted free agency."

440,Washington Wizards,SF,5,Otto Porter,"Coach Scott Brooks is a ""big believer"" in Otto Porter's potential, according to NBA.com's David Aldridge.","Interesting. Brooks got on fantasy owners' nerves at times for cutting down minutes on guys like Serge Ibaka. This is a good start for Porter after a mini-breakout in 2015-16. If he can be consistent and stay healthy, it's definitely possible for Porter to be an early-round value next season."
